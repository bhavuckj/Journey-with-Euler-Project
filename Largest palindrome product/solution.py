    Problem Statement :
        A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit
        numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

        Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# first we will calculate all the palindrome between 100 to 999 since they want the largest palindrome product for 3-digit number
